# Force the latest version of pylint pyflakes and pep8. There are numerous issues with older versions.
# FIXME: pylint-django does not work with the latest pylint (1.8.0 or 1.8.1).
# See https://github.com/landscapeio/pylint-django/issues/108
# Remove the upper limit when the problem gets resolved.
pylint   >= 1.7.5, < 1.8.0
pyflakes >= 1.6.0

# FIXME: There's a bug in astroid that makes pylint print spurious warnings about unused __class__ variable.
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1609
# It's fixed in pylint 1.8.1 but we can't upgrade yet because pylint-django does not work with pylint 1.8.1 yet.
# When it's fixed, remove the line below and start requiring pylint version >= 1.8.1.
astroid < 1.6.0
